Readme

What is the extension about?

Why do I need this? Isn't the browser password manager or 1Password enough?

What about security?
	- Explain the use of SJCL - Stanford JavaScript Cryptographic Library
	- Urls, usernames and passwords are not stored in any cloud
	- They are synced between your Chrome devices using the API chrome.storage.sync

This extension doesn't work the way I expect it to. File a bug report here (github link)

If you have read this far, Thank You!
